<h1>Continuing</h1>
<p>Vettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off 
    racing appearance in 2007. As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso 
    later that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. 
    With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the sport's
